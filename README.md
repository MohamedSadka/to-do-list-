# To-Do List Program

This project is a simple to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a straightforward interface to manage their tasks.

## Features

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, including elements such as headings, input fields, buttons, and lists for creating a user interface.

- **CSS Styling**: The CSS file styles the HTML elements to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application, setting colors, fonts, layout, and overall presentation.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: The JavaScript file adds interactivity and functionality to the program, handling user input to add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks dynamically.

- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the to-do list by adding new tasks using an input field and a "Add" button. Each task is displayed in a list format with options to mark as complete or delete.

- **Persistence** (Optional): Depending on the implementation, the program may include features for persisting tasks across sessions, such as using local storage or connecting to a server-side database.

## Usage

To use the to-do list program, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can then add new tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them as needed.
